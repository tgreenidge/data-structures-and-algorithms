# Data Structures & Algorithms File Structure for Code 401: Java
This repo shows the expected file structure for Code 401: Java data structures & algorithms. The command gradle init --type java-library was run inside of the code401challenges directory, and that code401challenges directory is the root from which I open IntelliJ.

This root README is where the links to daily work should live.
