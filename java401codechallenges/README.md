## ArrayShift Challenge

Given an array and a value, insert the value in the middle of the array. 

## Approach & Efficiency
I approached it by copying the contents to a new (output) array one at a time until the position for the value to be inserted into the output array. Once the value to be inserted was added, I continued adding the rest of the elements of the input array to the output array.
